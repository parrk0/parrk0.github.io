                 <p>Terraria is an action adventure sandbox game with many recognizable mechanics like crafting, building, and combat. At the start of the game you customize your character with the many options available and then generate a world. From there it is up to you to explore, loot, and make your character stronger to prepare for boss fights. Defeating bosses is how you progress through Terraria. This site contains information about the bosses that must be defeated to unlock Hardmode, which marks the beginning of the game's more challenging second phase.</p>

                <p>The Eye of Cthulhu is the first boss you need to defeat to progress. This fight can take plcae in any biome in your world, but only at night time. Once a player has obtained over 200 HP, the Eye of Cthulhu will have a 1/3 chance of spawning at the start of each night. This boss doesn't necesarily drop anything too important. Once defeated you will be awarded some demonite/crimtane ore, some healing potions, money, and maybe a couple of other items that arn't that common.</p>
